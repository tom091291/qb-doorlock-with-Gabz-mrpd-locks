# qb-doorlock-with-Gabz-mrpd-locks
this is just the Config file for qb-doorlock that has Gabz MRPD added in

to use this download the config and choose whether you want to copy just Gabz MRPD section or use the config as a whole,

the text coords are a bit weird, not sure why but they dont sit at the right Vector3 that has been set

i will be adding more of Gabz doors in once i have them working

Hope this makes things easier for anyone using it
